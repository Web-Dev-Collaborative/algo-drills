# Glossary
An incomplete listing of terms used in the algorithms, usually as variable names. This focuses on terms that are likely new or have a more specific meaning in this codebase.

#### Adjacent
Nodes are adjacent if there's an edge between them.

#### Path
A sequence of edges that connect a sequence of nodes. In this codebase, it's usually expressed as the sequence of nodes that are connected.

#### Connected
Nodes are connected if there's a path between them. A graph is connected if all of its nodes are connected.

#### Component
A subgraph where all nodes are connected to each other and not connected to any other nodes. Commonly called a connected component.

#### Seen
Items that have been placed in a collection to be processed, or decided never to be added.

#### Visited
Items that have been removed from a collection for processing.

#### Degree
The degree of a node is the count of the edges going to and from that node. In-degree is the number of directed edges going to that node.

#### Ret
A variable name for the return value of a function when the output is obvious, and a better name isn't available.

#### Next Node
An adjacent node. Most likely it's getting added to a collection of nodes to visit.
